                <h1 class="poem-title">The Lay of Beren and L&#250;thien</h1>
                <p class="poem">The leaves were long, the grass was green,<br>
                        The hemlock-umbels tall and fair,<br>
                        And in the glade a light was seen<br>
                        Of stars in shadow shimmering.<br>
                        Tinúviel was dancing there<br>
                        To music of a pipe unseen,<br>
                        And light of stars was in her hair,<br>
                        And in her raiment glimmering.</p>
                <p class="poem">There Beren came from mountains cold,<br>
                        And lost he wandered under leaves,<br>
                        And where the Elven-river rolled<br>
                        He walked alone and sorrowing.<br>
                        He peered between the hemlock-leaves<br>
                        And saw in wonder flowers of gold<br>
                        Upon her mantle and her sleeves,<br>
                        And her hair like shadow following.</p>
                <p  class="poem">Enchantment healed his weary feet<br>
                        That over hills were doomed to roam;<br>
                        And forth he hastened, strong and fleet,<br>
                        And grasped at moonbeams glistening.<br>
                        Through woven woods in Elvenhome<br>
                        She lightly fled on dancing feet,<br>
                        And left him lonely still to roam<br>
                        In the silent forest listening.</p>
                <p class="poem">He heard there oft the flying sound<br>
                        Of feet as light as linden-leaves,<br>
                        Or music welling underground,<br>
                        In hidden hollows quavering.<br>
                        Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves,<br>
                        And one by one with sighing sound<br>
                        Whispering fell the beachen leaves<br>
                        In the wintry woodland wavering.</p>
                <p class="poem">He sought her ever, wandering far<br>
                        Where leaves of years were thickly strewn,<br>
                        By light of moon and ray of star<br>
                        In frosty heavens shivering.<br>
                        Her mantle glinted in the moon,<br>
                        As on a hill-top high and far<br>
                        She danced, and at her feet was strewn<br>
                        A mist of silver quivering.</p>
                <p class="poem">When winter passed, she came again,<br>
                        And her song released the sudden spring,<br>
                        Like rising lark, and falling rain,<br>
                        And melting water bubbling.<br>
                        He saw the elven-flowers spring<br>
                        About her feet, and healed again<br>
                        He longed by her to dance and sing<br>
                        Upon the grass untroubling.</p>
                <p class="poem">Again she fled, but swift he came.<br>
                        Tinúviel! Tinúviel!<br>
                        He called her by her elvish name;<br>
                        And there she halted listening.<br>
                        One moment stood she, and a spell<br>
                        His voice laid on her: Beren came,<br>
                        And doom fell on Tinúviel<br>
                        That in his arms lay glistening.</p>
                <p class="poem">As Beren looked into her eyes<br>
                        Within the shadows of her hair,<br>
                        The trembling starlight of the skies<br>
                        He saw there mirrored shimmering.<br>
                        Tinúviel the elven-fair,<br>
                        Immortal maiden elven-wise,<br>
                        About him cast her shadowy hair<br>
                        And arms like silver glimmering.</p>
                <p class="poem">Long was the way that fate them bore,<br>
                        O'er stony mountains cold and grey,<br>
                        Through halls of ireon and darkling door,<br>
                        And woods of nightshade morrowless.<br>
                        The Sundering Seas between them lay,<br>
                        And yet at last they met once more,<br>
                        And long ago they passed away<br>
                        In the forest singing sorrowless.</p>
